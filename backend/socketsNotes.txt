REST
- request-response communication model
- stateless
- client initiates requests
- server cant push data to client

Sockets
- bidirectional communication between client and server
- persistent connection
- real-time data exchange
- server can push data to client without client requesting it
- client can also send data to server anytime

Socket.IO is library built on top of WebSockets
- it has event-based communication model
- it provides fallbacks for older browsers that do not support WebSockets
- it simplifies real-time communication implementation
- automatic reconnects - if connection drops, it tries to reconnect automatically
- rooms and namespaces - logical grouping of sockets for targeted communication
- broadcasting - send messages to multiple clients simultaneously
- events like connection, custom like "group:message:new"
